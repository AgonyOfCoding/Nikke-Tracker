Requires 2 lines if you don't use Maxwell with her. Lately we've been using her without Maxwell more so it's recommended to go 2 lines of Charge Speed (total of 7.06% or higher Charge Speed within 2 lines). Max Ammo is necessity especially since you run her typically with Privaty which has Max Ammo reduction or Noir which has Ammo Refresh. Fast Shooting is her typical gameplay which means she uses up ammo fast so Max Ammo and Resilience Cube are necessary. You can have entire ammo capacity shooting without reloading with Bastion during burst if you have have enough Ammo capacity with Liter+Noir"
