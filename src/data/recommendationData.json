With 98.88% Charge Speed, she can full charge within frame 1 and thus releasing full charge quickly. If you pair her with Maxwell, she only needs 1 line of it. Requires 2 lines if you don't use Maxwell with her. Lately we've been using her without Maxwell more so it's recommended to go 2 lines of Charge Speed (total of 7.06% or higher Charge Speed within 2 lines). Max Ammo is necessity especially since you run her typically with Privaty which has Max Ammo reduction or Noir which has Ammo Refresh. Fast Shooting is her typical gameplay which means she uses up ammo fast so Max Ammo and Resilience Cube are necessary. You can have entire ammo capacity shooting without reloading with Bastion during burst if you have have enough Ammo capacity with Liter+Noir"

In most teams, Bastion is obviously the better choice. However, in reload speed teams (SAnis + Privaty), you need to do some testing first. Either Resilience or Bastion would fit your situation better, depending on Privaty's S1 investment as well as the number of OL lines. Boot into Shooting Range without equipping any cube and do normal rotations. Just before Full Burst ends, force-reload Elegg. Now, keep shooting until you reach the next Full Burst. Here are several outcomes: If Elegg reloads outside Full Burst, use Bastion. If you still need to reload, get 1 Max Ammo line and try again. Or, you can try to time your reload so that it starts before Privaty's buff disappears and finishes after Privaty's debuff disappears. This way, Elegg reloads to her full ammo capacity. If Elegg does not reload outside Full Burst, you can use either cube, but Resilience can save you ~11 frames per reload by reaching the >109% threshold. Do provide some leeway. For instance, having ±30 ammo when Full Burst begins is too tight. You can always get more Max Ammo lines, but it may not be efficient. For both cases above, you need to make sure that Elegg does not lose fire rate when reloading by making sure Privaty's S1 is invested well enough. No, it doesn't have to be >100% or >109%. Without sufficient reload speed, reloads will cause uncomfortable hiccups during Full Burst. If this occurs, use Resilience instead and reload outside Full Burst (still reload at the end of Full Burst), or obtain Max Ammo lines. That being said, we do recommend minimum 1–2 Max Ammo lines as a DPS."

A necessity especially when she's the only unit that can be fast charged in your team. Charge Damage is fairly decent stat for Maxwell compared to other units mainly because she has high ATK multiplier during her burst which complements her having higher Charge Damage. Fast Shooting is her typical gameplay which means she uses up ammo fast so Max Ammo and Resilience Cube are necessary.

If you rolled Max Ammo first on your first OL on her, it's fine to keep it that way and don't need to pursue having Hit Rate. Max Ammo Capacity improves Modernia's damage greatly and scales well with Bastion Cube. Having 2 is enough if you burst with her but ideally more is better specially since she is better when she doesn't burst. Switching to Bastion Level 3 (refund 2 bullets per 10 hit) is equivalent multiplier to 1.25x your bullets so at 1 OL where you have Hit Rate line but no Max Ammo, switching to using Bastion Cube is equivalent to having a 25% max ammo capacity (300+76 bullets). Bastion Level 7 (refund 3 bullets) is roughly 1.43x multiplier. Depending on your rolls, you might end up needing Hit Rate line by second or third OL gear. As a side note, at around 140% Max Ammo with Bastion Level 3 (or 105% Max Ammo with Bastion Level 7) which is essentially 900-1000 effective bullets, you can loop Modernia's burst without reloading when using a Cooldown Reduction Unit (e.g. Liter).

There's no stacks to upkeep on Nihilister but she still needs full charge shots so Charge Speed is necessary to have high uptime of skill 1 which is where a bigger portion of her kit and high scaling is emphasized. Unlike other DPS, Nihilister is more used on campaign or other mob stages so there's less importance on Elemental Damage and also there's less priority on upgrading skills (for bossing). But if you choose to make her be a mainstay in your campaign pushing, then upgrading skills is a must in order to pad CP. Note that there's ammo breakpoints at burst level 6 and level 9. A big warning beforehand that due to lack of resources union raid chips, it'll take a while before we get duplicates of her so she will be at a disadvantage on CP for campaign pushing."
